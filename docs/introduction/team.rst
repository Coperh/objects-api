=========================================

The Objects and Objecttypes API project was initiated by six organizations to
standardize common "other" objects that are currently not exposed via an API.

In alphabetical order, they are:

* Amsterdam

* Utrecht

The municipality of **Utrecht** takes the lead in this project.
