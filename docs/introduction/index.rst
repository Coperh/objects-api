Introduction
============

To store and expose various types of domain specific data, or objects, we need
an appropriate API. Domain specific objects can be a "report", "dog", "tree", 
"parking permit", "complaint", "family", or anything really.

Organizations, specifically municipalities, want to store, retrieve and connect
these different kind of objects. For example: A "Zaak" should be able to refer 
to a parking permit, or many types of objects need to be shown on a geographic 
map.

These object registrations are necessary in the IT-landscape to create domain
specific applications according to the Common Ground principles.
Standardization of the object definitions is necessary to prevent divergent 
solutions and implementations.
