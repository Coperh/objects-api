Background
==========

There are many, many data sources available or desired. These data sources are
stored on various media, ranging from an Excel file to a database. Also, these 
format in which the data is stored often differs even though it concerns the 
same type of objects. Information models are often available, in various levels
of completeness and each organization decides how to implement and expose these
models to the outside world.

With the Objecttypes API an attempt is made to go beyond an information model 
and create a standard on a message exchange level, in the form of JSON schema.

Related initiatives
-------------------

The Objects and Objecttypes API idea is not unique but combines international 
standards, ideas and existing applications and data models. There are several
projects that are related or similar to this project.

* The municipality of Amsterdam has a similar initiative using Amsterdam Schema 
  (`link <https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-schema>`__)
* Information models in Norway use JSON schema 
  (`link <https://data.norge.no/informationModels/b133bafa-c089-45b7-93e0-19387cefc89e>`__)

Various data sources
--------------------

There are many existing data sources that could potentially be converted to an
objecttype definition.

* The Dutch government has many open data sources including meta data 
  (`link <https://data.overheid.nl/>`__)
* For Dutch geographical objects, there are information models defined
