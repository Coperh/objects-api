===================
Postman collections
===================

To play around with the APIs we constructed `Postman`_ collections that work
with the demo data supplied with the :ref:`installation_quickstart`.

These Postman collections are a set of pre-constructed API-calls to access the
most commonly used resources and query parameters. The configuration matches
the :ref:`installation_quickstart` configuration but can be changed to match
your own setup.

To import the collection into Postman, follow the next steps:

#. Open the Postman application.
#. At the top left, click on ``File -> Import``, or CTRL+O.
#. Drag the file or browse using ``Upload Files`` button.
#. Click ``Import``.
