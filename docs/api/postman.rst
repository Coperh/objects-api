===================
Postman collections
===================

To play around with the API's we constructed `Postman`_ collections that work
with the demo data supplied with the :ref:`installation_quickstart`.

These Postman collections are a set of pre-constructed API-calls to access the
most commonly used resources and query parameters. The configuration matches
the :ref:`installation_quickstart` configuration but can be changed to match
your own setup.

* :download:`Objects API<_assets/objects-api.postman_collection.json>`
* :download:`Objecttypes API<_assets/objecttypes-api.postman_collection.json>`
* :download:`Object and Objecttypes configuration (quickstart)<_assets/object-and-objecttypes-quickstart.postman_environment.json>`
